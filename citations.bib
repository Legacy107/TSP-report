When a graph is unweighted, any spanning tree is a minimum spanning tree. The minimum spanning tree can be found in polynomial time. Common algorithms include those due to Prim (1957) and Kruskal's algorithm (Kruskal 1956). The problem can also be formulated using matroids (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz 1982). A minimum spanning tree can be found in the Wolfram...},

For example, the spanning trees of the cycle graph C\_4, diamond graph, and complete graph K\_4 are illustrated above. The number of nonidentical spanning trees of a graph G is equal to any cofactor of the degree matrix of G minus the adjacency matrix of G (Skiena 1990, p. 235). This result is known as the matrix tree theorem. A tree contains a unique spanning tree, a cycle graph C\_n...},

In a mathematician's terminology, a graph is a collection of points and lines connecting some (possibly empty) subset of them. The points of a graph are most commonly known as graph vertices, but may also be called "nodes" or simply "points." Similarly, the lines connecting the...},

	abstract = {A tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections between elements, giving a tree graph. Trees were first studied by Cayley (1857). McKay maintains a database of trees up to 18 vertices, and Royle maintains one up to 20 vertices. A tree is a set of straight line segments connected at their ends containing no closed loops (cycles)....},
